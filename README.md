# Salary-Determinants-Dashboard-PowerBI-Python-
Project Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard that provides a high-level analysis of salary data by examining key demographic and career-related factors. The dashboard allows users to explore how average salary levels vary across gender, education level, years of experience, and age groups.

The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query to ensure consistency, remove missing or incorrect values, and create additional calculated fields such as age bands for improved analysis.

Purpose of the Dashboard
The purpose of this dashboard is to provide an interactive visual analysis of salary data by exploring how average salary levels vary across key demographic and career-related factors. It enables users to observe patterns and trends across gender, education level, years of experience, and age groups without making predictive or causal assumptions.
